           <h3>I Found You</h3>
           <p><b>"Once Upon a Dream"</b><br>

            Once upon a time, in a world not so different from ours, there was a young man who had always felt something missing in his life. He didn't know exactly what it was, but he longed for something‚Äîor rather, someone‚Äîto share the little moments with: sunsets, laughter, and those secret dreams he never told anyone.

            <br><br>One cool autumn evening, as he walked through a quiet, enchanted forest bathed in golden light, he spotted a figure sitting on a bench beneath a grand oak tree. She was wrapped in a soft scarf, her head tilted up toward the sky, her eyes full of wonder. As he approached, their eyes met, and it felt as though time itself had paused, holding its breath in reverence for this simple, perfect moment.
            
            <br><br>From that day forward, they were inseparable. Together, they wandered through fields of wildflowers, chased waves at the beach, and shared stories under starlit skies. They built dreams together, painted with laughter and love, and turned every ordinary day into something extraordinary.
            
           <br><br> But what made their love truly magical was not the grand moments, but the little things: the way she would laugh at his silly jokes, how he could read her thoughts just from a look, and the comfort they found in each other‚Äôs presence, even in silence. They both knew that this love was rare and beautiful, like a fairy tale they‚Äôd only ever read about.
            
           <br><br> One evening, while watching the sun set on the horizon, he turned to her and whispered, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the dream I never knew I was waiting for.‚Äù She smiled, her cheeks glowing with the warmth of the setting sun, and in that moment, he knew that no matter where life took them, they would always find their way back to each other.
            
            And so, with hearts full of love and eyes full of wonder, they continued their story‚Äîa love story that felt like it had always been written in the stars.
